This folder contains two versions of Utter Command DVC files. These are the files that contain all the UC speech input commands. 
UC Extended is contains all the UC commands. 
UC Common is the up-to-date and practical version. It leaves out some of the compute-intensive advanced commands that most people donâ€™t need. I usually start people out with this, and add advanced commands from UC Extended if necessary. UC Common also has notes that show which Extended commands were left out.

Install the updated UC Common files by replacing the files of the same name in C:\ProgramData\Nuance\NaturallySpeaking15\Data\enx\dvcu\general folder
