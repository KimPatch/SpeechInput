This folder contains two versions of Utter Command DVC files. These are the files that contain all the UC speech input commands. 

It also contains Utter Command DLL calls, a list of the DLL calls that UC uses to expand Dragon Functionality.

UC Common is the up-to-date and practical version of the Utter Command DVC files. It leaves out some of the compute-intensive advanced commands that most people donâ€™t need. I usually start people out with this, and add advanced commands from UC Extended if necessary. The UC Common files contain notes that show which Extended commands were left out.

UC Extended contains all the UC commands. It includes advanced commands that can be added as needed to the UC Common set.

Install the updated UC Common files by replacing the files of the same name in C:\ProgramData\Nuance\NaturallySpeaking15\Data\enx\dvcu\general folder
