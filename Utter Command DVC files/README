This file contains three versions of the Utter Command DVC files. These are the files that contain all the UC speech input commands. 
UC Extended contains all the UC commands. 
UC Common leaves out some of the compute-intensive advanced commands that most people donâ€™t need. I usually start people out with this. UC Common also has notes that show which Extended commands were left out.
UC Current is what I use. It iis based on UC Common but includes the advanced commands that I find most useful plus several command sets for specific programs.
